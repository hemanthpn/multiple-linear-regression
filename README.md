# Glimpse of the project

.The main objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the Air Quality Index
.Each record in the dataset includes the levels of key pollutants along with the corresponding AQI value. These pollutants serve as the independent variables, while AQI is the dependent variable. The dataset is 
 designed to mimic real-world conditions, enabling the development and testing of linear regression models.
.The methodology involved preprocessing the data, handling missing values. 
The models were trained using multiple linear regression and the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess prediction accuracy.
